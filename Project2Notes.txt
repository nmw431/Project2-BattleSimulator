Project 2(Battle Simulator)

What is meant to happen.

*Beginning the Project will have pick a character, displaying and image of Character and their stats. Only starting the
battle when you select start batte, Blitzadile is selected by default.
*Turns will be displayed as well as what the player did that turn and what the enemy did.
Battle Screen displays Player/Enemy, Name, Current Health / Max Health, and a progress bar as the health bar.
The health bars will change color to yellow at 49 percent to red at 29 percent. 
*Battle option will have attack or quit, if you select attack you will see 3 moves and back. The move will play
out the next turn with your selected move and a random move from the oponent, back take back to Attack and Quit.
Quit takes you back to the character select screen. 
*If enough turns play out where either the player or enemy hp are at zero, you be taken to the attack/quit screen
so you can view the last turn, this will display the result on the right end of the screen. Either attack or quit will take 
you back to the character select screen.

Expected Results for Damage

Refer to CharacterStats.csv to see specific values.

*Move 1 will not be highlighted with a color indicating an element. It represents physical damage.
Will never get elemental bonus or lowered damage for attacking an opponent with a favorable or disfavorable
matchup. Physical damage is the only damage type that includes "Attack" so it is more consistent than elemental
damage but does'nt get the same highs. The power stat is the main value used in damage calculation. Physical
get bonus Attack damage to keep up with elemental damage.

Physical Attack Damage = Attack + Power1
-Blitzadile Bite should always do 4 damage and say "Effective." (Attack = 3) + (Power1 = 1) = 4.
-Jormangandr Slam should always do 2 damage and say "Effective." (Attack = 1) + (Power1 = 1) = 2.
-Totogaia Headbutt should always do 3 damage and say "Effective." (Attack = 2) + (Power = 1) = 3.



*Elemental Damage can hit really hard or be dissapointing in damage depending on matchup. Damage doubles
in a favorable matchup. (Move * 2) or Loses a point in damage (Move - 1), if match is disfavorable or the same. 
(Move - 1) I did minus one in damage since the move would be to weak if it was halved. There are weak elemental
moves(move2) and strong elemental moves(move3). All weak elemental moves have the same power of (Power2) = 2. The
Strong Elemental Moves also have the same power of (Power3 = 3). If we apply the doubling and subtracting the 
values below show that. There are not neutral elemental move so the damage will always be modified in the 
context of this project since there are only three character, 2 situations resist and 1 weak. Damage values below:

*Elemental moves will be indicated using colors to show what element they are. Green for grass. Blue for Water. Orange for fire.

Weak Elemental Moves: Pour, Spark, Growth.
Power2 = 2

Pour hitting Fire(Blitzadile): (Power2 * 2) = 4 damage. "Very Effective"
Pour hitting Water(Jormangandr) or Grass(Totogaia): (Power2 - 1) = 1 damage. "Not very effective"

Spark hitting Grass(Totogaia): (Power2 * 2) = 4 damage. "Very Effective"
Spark hitting Water(Jormangandr) or Fire(Blitzadile): (Power2 - 1) = 1 damage. "Not very effective"
